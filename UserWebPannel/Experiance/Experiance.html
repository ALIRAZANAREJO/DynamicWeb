also add global degrees of uni like when user select field like computer science then display its subcatogories like it,ai,programming, networking, cyber security, when he select medical then display list mbbs neurologist pharmacy, bds,whatever every types exixts in world also use make dropdown advance with arrow direction and entre key also when user type like cy then match result like show cyber security now show me whole structure also suggest me how we make more advance and what we missing when any user from world wide if he upload its expcation whats things we need to add and how its looks and also thing about creative and advance options for this form i think you understand my idea so think deep and then answer shortly and easy to undertsand me also show steps and no gen code 

ok cleary listen all data will save with this button id       <button class="sbbt" id="submitBtn">Submit</button>
 i have store data in database code first gen its html and css and then we will work at js because it will be to long we will distribute in 3 to 4 js files and forget user privecy and auto data delete expire data and add all importand features you define first only 
 show me html and css then we will discuse because global select digrees these function are important 
 so we work one by one



 according to style now add option like if user want to upload its another documents 
 in each degree then if he click add option then create input for "document name" 
  with choose pdf or img  also make ui animated and proffesional because when we work
   database code then we cant discuse about ui so make it perfect now animated feature
    is make a circle like ball with one outer layer have 5 colors like school college 
    uni master phd also always rotate slowly when page loge then scoll form will open 
    and ball come to right side with small size for few seconds to display user how it
     work and then comes to its with big size to its origional centre position and rotate
      slowly when user click any degree then open its input means its form and ball will 
      go to right side when i click uni then balls still a 
 tright side but uni form will displayed according to its institde selected did you understand -->
